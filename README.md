#Pointless test 

Today I made a test in the website hackerrank. And then I reflect. How pointless it is to do this test. As todays technology can write much better code than humans. If the machine does have access to 
multiple sources of information. Then the human could actually need to do very litle. 

I am not good at grammatical things at coding. Nut it does not matter. What matters is the overall logic. Creativity and system thinking. I think this is what matters regardless technology waves. 
I wonder how humans will see this in like 100 years from now. Haa do you know. that during that times, some humans ( that suppose they knew a bit , a bit more than others ) were testing other humans to 
measure their "knowledge". 

I sometimes reflect untill which point konwledge is intelligence. Either intelligence is the ability to solve problems?.
